# waze-userscript-sources
A small application to revrieve the sources of the userscripts known to have been developed for the Waze Map Editor

This application requests a CSV file that contains the URL of the source of the userscript in the first column and the name of the script as the second column. This script will download all those userscripts to a local folder so you can search through it with a search program of your choice. I use Notepad++'s "Search in files" feature.
